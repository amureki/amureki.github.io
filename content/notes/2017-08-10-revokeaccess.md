Somewhere in a Twitter, I found a couple of links to social networks settings
and advice to check the list of third-party services, which have access to your account.
I started going through my social accounts and cleaning there.

That was a horrible mess, sometimes I did not recognize what is this service
is used for and why I gave it permissions.

So, I've just decided to keep a list of links to social accounts settings,
so I can revisit it sometimes and clean up again.

Here is a link to it: [https://amureki.me/revokeaccess/](https://amureki.me/revokeaccess/)
