## How I Can Help

Your Django project deserves better than duct tape fixes and slow CI pipelines.  
I help teams **clean up**, **stabilize**, and **speed up** their codebases — without derailing ongoing work.

### What I Do
- Untangle legacy Django projects and bring them back to a maintainable state
- Hunt down performance bottlenecks — from *10 queries per page* to *1000 hidden inside a serializer*
- Modernize your stack: upgrade to the latest **Python / Django**, refresh outdated dependencies, and make your builds reproducible (uv / poetry / pipenv — whatever fits best)
- Improve CI, linting, and testing setups so code reviews focus on logic, not formatting
- Add observability and resilience: **Sentry**, **prefetch/caching**, async, and test coverage where it actually matters

### Why Me
- Building with Django since **1.4 / Python 2.6**
- Published my first [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/user/amureki/) in **2015**
- Worked with and advised **dozens of Django teams** — from startups to mature products
- Core maintainer of [Model Bakery](https://github.com/model-bakers/model_bakery), a testing library used by teams worldwide
- Found and responsibly disclosed security flaws in a Django-based fintech app (out of pure curiosity)
- Based in **Berlin**, available across **EU time zones**
