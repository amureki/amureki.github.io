If you like my work and want to keep me motivated — here are some ways to say thanks:

- [Follow/tag me on X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/amureki) — say hi!
- [Buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/amureki) — I'll literally buy a coffee with it
- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/amureki) — for tech-savvy people, I guess
- [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/amubase) — when you are old enough to have a PayPal account
- [Revolut](https://revolut.me/amureki) — if you have Revolut, then this is quick and without fees

Cheers! 🍻
