This is a list of things that I am not going to buy myself,
but I would be happy to receive as a gift.

* [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) - not sure what I'd do with it, but could be an interesting toy.
I could maybe copy my gym chip to it, as I always forget it.

* [c√¥te&ciel Nile Obsidian Black](https://eu.coteetciel.com/products/nile-obsidian-black) - stylish,
but also a practical bag for my laptop and other stuff.

* [minirig 3](https://minirigs.co.uk/speakers/bluetooth-minirig-3) and [minirig sub 3](https://minirigs.co.uk/speakers/minirig-subwoofer-3) -
best-in-class portable bluetooth speaker.
I already have one of those, but the best setup would be to have two of them and a subwoofer.
